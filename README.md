# Firestone-Autoclicker

Current version works as-is for someone:
- Who has pip-installed the necessary libraries manually (see main.py for dependencies)
- Who is a PC player in fullscreen and 1080p (due to the coordinates being based on fullscreen and 1080p)
- Who plays in alphabetical language (due to the OCR nature)
- Is level 200+, but before Titan Missions (due to needing to unlock oracle)

Any variations may not work as-is, and code needs to be modified and/or improved to suit one's needs
